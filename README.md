## üöÄ About Lightning Bounties

In the current landscape, many open-source bug bounty platforms inadvertently shut out developers from regions outside the USA and EU, creating barriers to participation and diversity. Lightning Bounties is revolutionizing open-source development by integrating Bitcoin payments directly into GitHub workflows.

Our platform empowers developers worldwide to earn Bitcoin for fixing bugs and contributing to open-source projects, while project maintainers gain access to global talent to solve their issues faster.

Born at the MIT Bitcoin Hackathon in April 2024, Lightning Bounties aligns with the core principles of both open-source software and Bitcoin movements-decentralization, transparency, and inclusivity.
